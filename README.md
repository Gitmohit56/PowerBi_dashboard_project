📊 Rape Case Analysis in India (2000–2010) — Power BI Dashboard
🔍 Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of reported rape cases in India from 2000 to 2010, using Power BI for data visualization. The dashboard helps uncover patterns based on victim age groups, state-wise distributions, and temporal trends, aiding in better understanding of crime statistics.

Total rape cases reported from 2000–2010.

Victim age group categorization:

14–18 years

18–30 years

30–50 years

Above 50 years

State-wise breakdown of reported cases.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze the total number of rape cases over a decade.

Identify most affected age groups.

Explore geographic distribution across Indian states.

Track annual trends in different age brackets.

📌 Key Insights
